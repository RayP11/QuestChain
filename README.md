## Built for the Edge

Most AI agent frameworks are designed around cloud inference — they assume fast APIs, abundant context windows, and predictable latency. QuestChain is built for the opposite: **consumer GPUs, local models, and constrained hardware.**

The engine is a custom Python async loop — no agent framework, no middleware stack. Just the Ollama Python client, `asyncio`, and a tight streaming loop written specifically to get the most out of small local models.

> *"All the power of AI, none of the cloud bills."*

**How it's optimized for edge hardware:**

- **No framework overhead.** The entire agent loop is ~100 lines of plain Python. Stream from Ollama, detect tool calls, execute, loop. No graph execution engines, no serialization layers, nothing between the model and your hardware.

- **Streaming from the first token.** Text tokens are yielded to the UI as they arrive from Ollama. You see output immediately — critical when you can't afford the latency of waiting for a full response before rendering.

- **`<think>` filtering on the stream.** Reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3 emit `<think>…</think>` blocks before their actual response. QuestChain strips them using a character-level state machine *as the stream arrives* — they never reach the context buffer, never consume your token budget, and never appear in the UI.

- **Per-model context tuning.** Each model preset specifies its own `num_ctx`, `num_predict`, and `temperature`. You're not running an 8B model with a 128k context window it can't fill — context is sized to match the model's actual capacity.

- **Direct GPU and CPU control.** `OLLAMA_NUM_GPU` and `OLLAMA_NUM_THREAD` pass through directly to Ollama's inference options. Pin layers to GPU, pin thread count — no abstraction layer in the way.

- **Approximate token counting, no tokenizer API.** Budget tracking uses `chars / 4` — a fast local approximation with no round-trip to the model. Context compaction triggers automatically before the window fills up.

- **Auto-compaction via the model itself.** When context gets tight, QuestChain keeps the 6 most recent messages and uses the model to summarise everything older into a single block. The summary replaces the raw history in the JSONL file — reclaiming space while preserving what matters.

- **Lazy skill loading.** Each skill contributes only its name and a one-line description to the system prompt (~24 tokens). The full skill content is only fetched into context when the agent explicitly calls `read_skill(name)`. A large skill library costs almost nothing at inference time.

- **Short system prompt by design.** The base system prompt is ~550 characters. Every token in the system prompt is repeated across every turn — keeping it small has a compounding effect on memory and speed over long sessions.

- **Parallel tool execution.** When the model issues multiple tool calls in one turn, they run concurrently via `asyncio.gather`. File reads, web searches, and shell commands that don't depend on each other don't wait in line.

- **Plain JSONL history, no database.** Conversation history is stored as one JSON object per line in `~/.questchain/sessions/`. Human-readable, zero-dependency, trivially debuggable.

---

## It Codes Itself

QuestChain has a `claude_code` tool that delegates programming tasks to Claude Code — Anthropic's AI coding agent running locally in your terminal. QuestChain uses this tool to develop its own codebase.

When QuestChain identifies a bug, wants a new feature, or needs to refactor something, it can hand off a coding task to Claude Code with full filesystem access, then review the result. This has already happened: features in QuestChain's codebase were written by QuestChain itself, using Claude Code as its hands.

This creates a feedback loop where the agent's own capabilities improve over time — without you writing a line of code.

```
  You: "add a command that summarizes my TASKS.md"
     ↓
  QuestChain reasons about what needs to change
     ↓
  Calls claude_code("add /summary command to cli.py that reads TASKS.md...")
     ↓
  Claude Code edits the files, runs tests, commits
     ↓
  QuestChain reviews the result and reports back
```

## Why QuestChain?

Most AI assistants send your conversations to the cloud, charge per token, and forget everything the moment you close the tab. QuestChain is different.

QuestChain runs entirely on your own hardware using [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Your data never leaves your machine. No API bills, no rate limits, no terms-of-service watching your messages. It works offline. It's yours.

And it's not a chatbot. QuestChain is a full **agentic loop** — it can search the web, read and write files, execute shell commands, schedule recurring tasks, send you Telegram messages, and work autonomously in the background while you focus on something else.

---

## Local vs. Cloud

| | QuestChain | Cloud AI |
|---|---|---|
| **Your data** | Stays on your machine | Sent to third-party servers |
| **Cost** | $0 after hardware | $/token or subscription |
| **Works offline** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **File & shell access** | Full, real filesystem | Sandboxed or unavailable |
| **Memory** | Persistent across sessions | Usually resets every chat |
| **Autonomous tasks** | Background busy work loop | Manual only |
| **Remote access** | Built-in Telegram bot | Separate product |
| **Model choice** | Any Ollama model | Locked to provider |
| **Self-improvement** | Codes its own codebase | ❌ |

---

## What It Can Do

- 🔍 **Web Search & Browse** — Find current information and extract full page content via Tavily
- 📁 **File Operations** — Read, write, edit, list, search files on your real filesystem
- 💻 **Shell Commands** — Run terminal commands and scripts directly
- 🧠 **Planning** — Break down complex tasks into steps with built-in todo tools
- 🖥️ **Self-Coding** — Delegate programming tasks to Claude Code; modify its own codebase

```

The engine streams tokens from Ollama, detects tool calls in the final chunk, executes them concurrently via `asyncio.gather`, appends results to the JSONL history, and loops — up to 30 iterations. When the context window fills up, old turns are summarised by the model and replaced in place. The loop exits when the model responds with text and no tool calls.

## Install

Open **PowerShell** and run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RayP11/QuestChain/main/install.ps1 | iex"
```

That's it. The installer handles everything automatically:
- **Ollama** — local LLM runtime
- **Python 3.13** — if not already installed
- **uv** — fast Python package manager
- **QuestChain** — installed and added to PATH
- **qwen3:8b** — default model pulled and ready

Takes ~5–10 minutes depending on your internet speed (the model download is the slow part).

Then run:

```
questchain start
```

On first run, QuestChain walks you through a short onboarding conversation and optionally sets up Telegram. After that, it remembers who you are.

> **Web search (optional):** Run `/tavily` inside QuestChain to set up your free [Tavily API key](https://tavily.com) and enable web search and browsing.

---

## Usage

```bash
# Start QuestChain
questchain start

# Use a specific model
questchain start -m qwen2.5:14b-instruct

# Resume a previous conversation by thread ID
questchain start -t <thread-id>

# Run without persistent memory
questchain start --no-memory

# Set the busy work interval (minutes)
questchain start --busy-work 30

# Disable background busy work
questchain start --no-busy-work

# List available model presets
questchain start --list-models
```

---

## Terminal Commands

|---|---|
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation |
| `/model` | Show current model and list available ones |
| `/thread` | Show current conversation thread ID |

| **Ctrl+D** | Exit QuestChain |

---

## Telegram Setup

QuestChain runs alongside the CLI as a Telegram bot, giving you remote access from your phone.

Run `/telegram` inside QuestChain and it walks you through the setup:

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram → `/newbot` → copy the token
2. Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) → copy your numeric user ID
3. Paste both into the `/telegram` wizard — credentials are saved automatically

Restart QuestChain and the bot starts alongside the CLI. The same conversation thread and memory is shared between CLI and Telegram — switch between them mid-conversation.

---

## Busy Work

QuestChain can work autonomously in the background on a timer. Drop tasks into `workspace/TASKS.md`:

```markdown
- [ ] Research the latest news on quantum computing and summarize key developments
- [ ] Check if any of my Python packages have available updates
- [ ] Draft a weekly status email based on my recent work
```

QuestChain picks up one task per tick, completes it using all its tools, marks it done, and sends you a summary — in the terminal and on Telegram if configured.

```bash
# Run with a 30-minute busy work interval
questchain start --busy-work 30
```

---

## Configuration
